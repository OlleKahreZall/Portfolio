## [Web scraping project - extracting data from the top 100 biggest cryptocurrencies](https://github.com/OlleKahreZall/Web-scraping-project)

* In this project, I have scraped the 100 biggest cryptocurrencies based on their market cap from [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/). 
* The web-crawling framework Scrapy was used. In addition, the portable framework Selenium was used since the web pages were dynamic.
* Information such as the daily volume, market cap, highest/lowest value for each cryptocurrency have been extracted. 
* This spider has fetched each cryptocurrency's data from its first day were documented on the cryptocurrency market (according to [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/)) to the 2nd of December. 
* In total, more than 800 000 data points have been extracted.

The web pages are scraped by using the script [cryptoscraper](https://github.com/OlleKahreZall/Web-scraping-project/blob/main/cryptoscraper.py) (see the file for more details). All the data collected from the web pages were stored in the csv file [cryptocurrencies_top-100.csv](https://github.com/OlleKahreZall/Web-scraping-project/blob/main/cryptocurrencies_top-100.csv).

Furthermore, the ipynb file [data-cleaning_visualization.ipynb](https://github.com/OlleKahreZall/Web-scraping-project/blob/main/data-cleaning_visualization.ipynb) was used to pre-process the data. It was also used to visualize the currently top 3 rated cryptocurrencies and their historical data. The figures below are generated by this script, which show the value (when the market closes), volume and the market cap for the respective cryptocurrency.
